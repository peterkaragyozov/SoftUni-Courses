Farewell
To my wife

Sometimes I will come into your dreams
as an unexpected and unwanted guest.
Do not leave me out on the road -
do not bar the doors.

I will enter quietly. Gently I will sit,
I will stare into the darkness to see you.
When I get enough of looking at you -
I will kiss you and go away.
